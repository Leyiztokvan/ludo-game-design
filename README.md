## Introduction
This project showcases the end-to-end UI/UX design process for a Ludo board game interface, created for a university Software Engineering course - GUI/UX exercise. It demonstrates the application of design concepts, research, hand-drawn and digital wireframes, and an interactive prototype built in Figma.

## Project Goals
- Design a clean, modern Ludo UI for desktop and smartphone form factors
- Demonstrate the design process (sketches → wireframes → prototype)
- Produce an interactive prototype in Figma with a short scenario demonstration
- Document background research and visual inspiration

## Key Features
- Hand-drawn and digital sketches for multiple styles (ancient/modern, desktop/smartphone)
- Wireframes and screen flows
- Interactive prototype (Figma)
- Demo video for a short game scenario
- Background research on the history and evolution of the Ludo game

## How to Navigate the Project
