# Exercise

In the *GUI Construction* lecture, an introduction to GUI design was given. 


In this week's exercise, we go back to pen and paper and learn how early GUI 
prototypes are sketched and designed. GUI mockups are dummies that are used to 
design a GUI and present some use cases without actually implementing program 
logic in the background. Initial mockups are often done with pen and paper, 
especially when designing a game interface. In addition, paper prototypes are 
used to simulate the user experience and get a first feeling on how the 
designed interface can be used.

In this exercise, you will draw mockups and create a prototype for the Ludo 
game.


## GUI Design

Before implementing a GUI, it is often a good idea to first think about how 
the GUI should look like. The easiest way to do this is by sketching out your 
ideas with pen and paper. In this part of the exercise, you **do not need to 
implement anything**. Instead, we focus on bringing the ideas to paper. To 
pass this part, **you must complete the following tasks**:

- Create at least 6 different sketches for the main view of the Ludo game. 
  Draw your sketches by hand (on paper and preferably with a pencil), take a photo or 
  scan the results, and add them to your repository. Your sketches can be 
  similar, but you should include at least three radically different designs.

- Select one of your sketches and create a paper prototype of your game. 
  Simulate the user experience by showing how the user interface can be used. 
  Take a picture of each (major) step. Your prototype should show the 
  following:
  - Start screen.
    - Selecting game parameters (number of players, number of tokens per player, 
      ...).
    - Initial board state.
    - Performing at least two player turns (including intermediate steps such as 
      rolling the dice and selecting the action).
    - Winning screen.
    - Whatever you intend to do after a game is played (is a rematch loaded? Are 
      you going back to the start screen? ...)

- Create a file `sketches.md` where you include the pictures for the 6 
  sketches you created before.

- Create a file `prototype.md`, where you include the pictures that show the 
  individual steps. For each picture, you should give a short description of 
  what it shows and what the user needs to do in order to get to the next one. 
  For example, you need to describe how the players can take action (clicking 
  on buttons, entering commands, ...).


## Notes

- Make sure that all your photos and/or scans are readable. If we can't read 
  them, we may ask you to redo them.

- Your designs can be intended for different devices. For example, you could 
  sketch a GUI for a smartphone or a console.

- Make sure you use proper markdown syntax in `sketches.md` and 
  `prototype.md`. If you are unsure about how to do that, read the [markdown 
  documentation](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

- Keep in mind that the GUI is not necessarily just about visualizing the 
  board. Maybe there is other useful information that you can present to the 
  user?

- Make sure that the prototype is not just a series of drawings. The idea is 
  that it is (partially) playable. For example, you should have game pieces 
  that you can move between taking pictures.

## Deadline

You have **one week** to complete this assignment. Please submit your solutions by pushing your code to the Git repository **within 7 days** of receiving the task.
