- For a closer look at the Figma files: visit the [prototype-figma](/designs/prototype-figma/) folder.
- The assets used in the prototype are available in the [assets-figma](/resources/assets-figma/) folder.

#### Short Demo of a Game Scenario

*A short interactive game scenario built in the free version of Figma â€” Player D wins.*

Note: GitHub does not support inline video playback, and this demo video (~9 MB) is too large to preview directly.

To watch the video: ðŸ‘‰ [Click here to download or open the demo video](../designs/prototype-figma/ludo-prototype-demo.mp4)

  Then in the upper-right corner of the opened video page `designs/prototype-figma/ludo-prototype-demo.mp4`, click the â€¢â€¢â€¢ menu and select "Download" if it doesnâ€™t play in your browser.
    
The design logic by always clicking on the dice to change turns between players is only implemented to showcase the functionalities of the game. A fully realistic interactive prototype scenario wasnâ€™t possible due to limitations in the free version of Figma.
