- For a closer look at the Figma files: visit the [prototype-figma](/designs/prototype-figma/) folder.
- The assets used in the prototype are available in the [assets-figma](/resources/assets-figma/) folder.

#### Short Demo of a Game Scenario

**Note**: GitHub can not show the demo video because of its size (~ 9 MB)

*The design logic by always clicking on the dice to change turns between players is only implemented to be able to showcase the functionalities of the game. It was not possible to make a realistic interactive prototype scenario because of the limited functionalities of Figma free version.*
