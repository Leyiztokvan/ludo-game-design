### The Origin of Ludo
Ludo's roots can be traced back to ancient India, where it was known as ***"Pachisi"***. This board Ludo game, *Pachisi* was originally played on a **cloth or wooden board, and the players used cowrie shells as dice and miniature figures or seeds as game pieces, also known as *gotis***. The board design was simple, with a **cross-shaped path and a center square**, and the objective of the game was for you to move all your pieces from the outer squares to the center before your opponents.

***Pachisi*** was a highly popular game in *India*, and as time changed, its popularity increased. Within time, it was adopted by the Mughal Emperors of India and was then modernized with a **few changes in the pieces and became known as "***Chaupar***". The ***Chaupar*** game, while very similar to that of ***Pachisi*** but instead of cowrie shells was played with 3 four-sided long dice*.

### The British Influence
With the arrival of the *British colonial period*, the ***Pachisi*** game made its way to *England*, where it **underwent a transformation in ludo board game design and rules**. It was rebranded as "***Ludo***," derived from the *Latin* word for "***I play***," by Alfred Collier, and became a popular game among the British elite. The **game's design was altered from the original design of the game board to include a square board divided into a grid of smaller squares and the *traditional Indian cowrie* shells were replaced with *cubed dice***.

### The Modern Ludo Board
Today's Ludo board design is a testament to the game's enduring popularity. The **game board consists of a *large square divided into four different colored quadrants***, with each quadrant featuring a circuitous path leading to a **central end zone**. The design is both visually appealing by being colorful and engaging and functional by being easily understandable and compatible with the Ludo rules, with clear distinctions between the different colored zones to prevent any confusion for players playing the Ludo game.
